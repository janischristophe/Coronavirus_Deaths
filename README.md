# **Covid-19**
## **Description**
After looking for projects to keep practicing my data analysis skills, I have found one that focuses on the preparation, processing, and visualization of the data. I gathered an extensive .csv file and was able to break that down into workable .xlsx files to be able to process the data. I then used SQL to aggregate the data to sets that are workable for visualization. This project helped expand upon my SQL knowledge and helped develop my visual skills further.
